## Need Help With Git?
You might not have used git before. Don't worry by following the [getting started](https://github.coventry.ac.uk/eggintod/chatBot#getting-started) section you will be able to grab our code and run it. I have created a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15hcAJ_JbFFlRi2ETfEzvyAO5gww4MC5464_qTIiNPoM/edit?usp=sharing) to help with the very basic commands of git. I have also found an interactive [web app](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) to help you get started with git.
